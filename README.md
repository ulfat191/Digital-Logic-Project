# Digital-Logic-Project
The steps that we have mini project is given below:
1. Task to implement “SAC-1027” using Seven Segment Display.
2. The number of inputs = n and therefore, the number of outputs = 2 . 𝑛 = 23 = 8
3. Create a table with the inputs and outputs.
4. Draw the K-Map from the truth table and determine the groups.
5. Derive the equations from the created groups using: a) SOP and b) POS both.
6. From the simplified equation draw logic diagrams using: a)i) Basic gates(SOP), a)ii)
Basic gates(POS) b)i) Universal NAND gates(SOP), b)ii) Universal NOR gates(POS)
7. Logisim simulation.
